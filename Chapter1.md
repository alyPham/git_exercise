It is a nice and sunny day.
Our cherry wakes up from his bed early in the morning. 
He has decided to start his new adventure for today.
Finishing brushing his branches and washing his leaf, he is ready for a new adventure.
With his door locked, he leaves his home, without noticing there is a rock on his way.
Oops, he falls on to the ground, and starts rolling away.
