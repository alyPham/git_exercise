It was a nice and sunny day.
Our cherry woke up from his bed early in the morning. 
He had decided to start his new adventure for today.
Finishing brushing his branches and washing his leaf, he was ready for a new adventure.
With his door locked, he left his home, without noticing there was a rock on his way.
Oops, he fell on to the ground, and started rolling away.
