Chapter 3
The Cherry felt unprecedented pressure from the giant, too strong that the Cherry imagined a giant anaconda twirling him. 
He could not breath. He wanted to scream so badly but the pressure kept him unable to voice. 

"I am the great Cherry of the CherryBlossom village. I just started my adventure. This can't be the end"

But it was the end, at least it's going toward to the end. With a voiceless sigh, he fainted.

The giant put the cherry in his basket and moved to the giant's kitchen.

The giant started to knead the dough. With all slapping sound, the great Cherry finally woke up.

"What is going on?"

He looked around and there are some of cherries whom he met before in other festivals.

There were some raspberries and blueberries as well. The giant started to pick everyone in the box.

He was holding a silver thing and everytime he put that into his friends, they started to bleed.

At the end, it was only him left.

The great Cherry started to look back on his pasts: some happiness, some regret, and many joys.

The silver thing is about a inch away from him. He was sad. Sad that he could not finish his adventure.

His courage and spirit motivated us to do well in project. As a memoir, we decided to call our team Cherry and did not make any suggestion for cherry pie in our app.
